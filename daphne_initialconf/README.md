# SLOW CONTROL DEVELOPMENT FOR DAPHNE 

## Parallel communication

### FMC
* FMC test
  - Build a board adapter for nucleo STM32H743ZI2 board for FMC test with an FPGA board.
  - Build a C program to send and receive data from FMC board.

### FPGA
  - Implement a system memory block in the FPGA board for FMC test
  - UART conectivity

### OPCUA
* OPCUA test
   - Implement OPCUA server on STM32H743ZI2 board
   - Create a basic application for send and receive data using an serial or ethernet connection.

## BOOTLOADER
  - Implement a Bootloader in the Nucleo-STM32H743ZI
